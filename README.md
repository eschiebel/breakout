# Breakout
The [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29) arcade game
implemented with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Alt](http://alt.js.org/),
and [Immutable data structures](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), just to see if this was possible.

I was curious, could a simple arcade game be written in react, where all the
game state is in a store and the various React components render to the virtual dom.
Could it keep up?  The short answer is, _yes_, though this game, a cheap knockoff of
the original, only has 2 moving parts.

The game-play at this point is dead-simple and not very interesting. I have
a bunch of ideas that could make
it much more fun to play, but it's really just an experiment.

Go ahead and [try it out](https://eschiebel.github.io/).
